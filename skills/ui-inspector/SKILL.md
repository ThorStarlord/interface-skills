# UI Inspector

A skill for turning a live or static implementation into an evidence report. It does not judge the implementation — it describes it. The judgment happens in `ui-redline`. The inspector's job is to ensure every redline decision is grounded in a measured fact rather than a remembered impression.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when:
- An implementation exists (live browser, running dev server, or static HTML/CSS) and the user wants to compare it against a spec.
- The user is about to run `ui-redline` and needs an evidence base to redline against.
- A previous redline cycle is complete and the user wants to verify fixes — re-run the inspector to capture the updated state.

Do **not** use this skill when:
- No implementation exists yet. There is nothing to inspect. Run `ui-generate-code` or build the feature first.
- The user only wants to review or improve the spec itself. Use `ui-spec-linter` for that.
- The user wants a quick visual sanity check without a structured report. This skill produces a full evidence report — overkill for a 30-second eyeball pass.

## Core principle

**Redlining without evidence produces opinions. Redlining with evidence produces facts.** An opinion says "the button looks too small." A fact says "the button's computed `padding` is `4px 8px`; the spec calls for `space.3` (12px) × `space.5` (20px)." The inspector exists to replace the opinion with the fact. It collects; it does not conclude.

## What to inspect

### 1. DOM inventory

List every interactive element on the inspected UI Scope by type. The goal is a census, not a summary — every element that a user can act on must appear in the table.

For each element, record:
- Element type (button, input, select, link, checkbox, radio, ARIA role widget, etc.)
- CSS selector or identifying attribute (ID, class, `data-testid`, or `aria-label`)
- Semantic role (`<button>`, `role="button"`, `<a href>`, `role="link"`, etc.)
- Whether semantic markup is present or the element is div-soup

Flag any interactive element that lacks semantic markup (e.g., a `<div>` with an `onClick` handler but no `role`, `tabindex`, or `aria-*` attributes). This is not a judgment — it is an observation for `ui-redline` to classify.

### 2. Computed styles sample

For the 5–10 most visually significant elements (primary CTA, main heading, body text, card surface style, input field, navigation item — whichever apply), record the browser-computed values at the primary breakpoint.

Collect for each element:
- Computed text color (hex or `rgb()`)
- Background color (hex or `rgb()`)
- Font size (px)
- Font weight (numeric)
- Border radius (px)
- Padding (top right bottom left, px)
- Margin (top right bottom left, px)
- Box shadow (full value or "none")

Do not round or approximate — record the exact computed value. If a value is `0px`, record `0px`, not "none" or blank.

### 3. Token usage check

Determine whether the implementation uses CSS custom properties (design tokens) or hard-coded literal values.

**Signs of token usage:**
- `color: var(--color-text-primary)` — token used
- `padding: var(--space-4)` — token used

**Signs of literal values:**
- `color: #1a1a1a` — literal, should be a token
- `padding: 16px` — literal, may or may not match a token value

Record:
- Number of CSS custom property (`var(--*)`) references found in the inspected stylesheet(s) or inline styles
- Every literal color value found (hex, `rgb()`, `hsl()`, named colors other than `inherit`/`transparent`/`currentColor`)
- Every literal spacing value found (px values in `padding`, `margin`, `gap`, `width`, `height`) that does not use a CSS variable

Do not evaluate whether literals are "correct" — record them as observations. `ui-redline` decides whether they violate the system spec.

### 4. Accessibility scan

Record every accessibility issue discovered via the browser accessibility tree, axe-core output, or manual inspection. Use the four-column format below.

**WCAG criteria to cover at minimum:**

| Criterion | What to check |
|---|---|
| 1.1.1 Non-text content | Every `<img>` has a non-empty `alt` attribute (or `alt=""` if decorative) |
| 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | Form inputs are programmatically associated with labels |
| 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) | Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (AA); large text ≥ 3:1 |
| 2.1.1 Keyboard | All interactive elements reachable by Tab |
| 2.4.3 Focus Order | Tab order matches visual reading order |
| 2.4.7 Focus Visible | Focus-visible indicator present on all interactive elements |
| 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | Interactive elements have accessible names and appropriate ARIA roles |

If axe-core is available, include a count of violations by impact level (critical, serious, moderate, minor).

### 5. Responsiveness check

At the primary breakpoint and at least one secondary breakpoint, record how the layout behaves.

For each breakpoint tested:
- Viewport width used
- Whether horizontal scrollbar appears (yes/no)
- Whether primary action is in the top half of the viewport (yes/no)
- Whether any text is clipped or overflow hidden (yes/no)
- Whether the layout matches the blueprint's specified reflow verb (stacked, collapsed, hidden, resized) — record as "matches", "partial", or "does not match"

## Tooling: two paths

### Path A — AI model with browser tooling (Playwright, Puppeteer, browser MCP)

The inspector can be run fully by an AI model in an environment that provides browser automation. Steps:

1. Open the target URL at the primary breakpoint viewport size.
2. Run `document.querySelectorAll('button, input, select, textarea, a[href], [role="button"], [role="link"], [tabindex]')` and enumerate results into the DOM inventory.
3. For each element in the computed styles sample, call `window.getComputedStyle(el)` and record the required properties.
4. Scan all stylesheets for `var(--*)` references and literal color/spacing values.
5. If axe-core is available, inject it and call `axe.run()`. Otherwise run the manual WCAG checks above.
6. Resize to each secondary breakpoint and observe layout behavior.

### Path B — Developer copying DevTools output (manual path)

If browser automation is not available, a developer runs the inspector manually:

1. **DOM inventory:** Open DevTools Elements panel. Filter for interactive elements. Paste the relevant HTML into the evidence report.
2. **Computed styles:** Select each element in DevTools → Computed tab. Screenshot or copy the relevant properties.
3. **Token usage:** DevTools → Sources → search stylesheets for `var(--`. Count references. Search for hex patterns `#[0-9a-f]{3,6}` and list findings.
4. **Accessibility:** DevTools → Accessibility panel for individual element checks. Or run axe DevTools browser extension.
5. **Responsiveness:** Toggle device toolbar. Test at each breakpoint. Screenshot each state.

Both paths produce the same evidence report schema. Note which path was used in the report header.

## Evidence report schema

Produce the evidence report in this exact structure. Save it as `inspector-report.md` in the `redlines/` directory of the spec package. If multiple inspection runs exist, add a date suffix: `inspector-report-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.

```markdown
---
spec_type: inspector-evidence
spec_id: <slug>
based_on: <spec package name or "none — no linked spec">
created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
inspection_method: <"automated (Playwright)" | "automated (Puppeteer)" | "automated (browser MCP)" | "manual (DevTools)">

| Mobile | 375px | Yes | No | Yes | Does not match |

**Notes:** <any additional observations about layout behavior>

---

## 6. Inspector notes

<Any observations that do not fit the structured tables above — e.g., "the loading state could not be inspected because the API endpoint is mocked", "dark mode was not tested because the spec does not address it.">

**This report contains evidence only. No judgments about correctness or severity are made here. Pass this report to `ui-redline` for evaluation against the spec.**
```

---

## Anti-pattern rules

1. **Do not make judgment calls in the evidence report.** "The button color is wrong" is a judgment. "The button's computed background is `#2563eb`; the spec token `color.action.primary` resolves to `#1d4ed8`" is evidence. Save the judgment for `ui-redline`.
2. **Do not skip the DOM inventory even if it seems obvious.** The DOM inventory is the foundation of the evidence report. An inspector that skips it is an inspector that cannot account for missing or extraneous elements.
3. **Do not approximate computed values.** Record `border-radius: 6px`, not "slightly rounded." The difference between 6px and 8px is a nit; the difference between "slightly rounded" and 6px is unresolvable.
4. **Do not omit literal values because they happen to match a token value.** If an element uses `padding: 16px` instead of `var(--space-4)`, record the literal even if 16px equals `space.4`. Token usage and token correctness are separate questions.
5. **Do not run the inspector against a spec instead of an implementation.** The inspector reads code and browsers, not markdown. If there is no implementation, say so and stop.

## Acceptance criteria for this skill's output

An evidence report produced by this skill is acceptable only if every one of these is true:

- [ ] All five sections (DOM Inventory, Computed Styles, Token Usage, Accessibility Findings, Responsiveness) are present, even if some contain "None found" or empty tables.
- [ ] The inspection method (automated or manual, and which tool) is declared in both the frontmatter and the report header.
- [ ] Every computed style value is the exact browser-computed value — no approximations, no rounding, no prose descriptions substituted for numeric values.
- [ ] The DOM inventory accounts for every interactive element on the inspected UI Scope — not just a representative sample.
- [ ] The Token Usage section lists every literal color and spacing value found, not just a count. A count alone is not actionable.
- [ ] The report contains zero judgment statements. Every sentence describes a measurement or observation. Evaluations ("this is wrong", "this is correct") are absent.
- [ ] If a section could not be completed (e.g., loading state was not triggerable), the reason is recorded in §6 Inspector notes rather than the section being silently omitted.

If any check fails, revise before delivering.
