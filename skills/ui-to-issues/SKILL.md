# UI to Issues

A skill for converting high-level UI specifications and audit findings into a set of discrete, actionable implementation tasks (issues). It prioritizes vertical slices of behavior over horizontal technical layers to ensure that every task results in a user-verifiable outcome.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill:
- When a new spec package is approved and ready for implementation.
- After a `ui-redline` audit to break down the required fixes into manageable tasks.
- To convert a `ui-spec-reconcile` report into a punch-list of remaining gaps.
- When you need to plan a sprint or milestone for a UI feature.

## Core principles

1. **Vertical Slices:** Prioritize issues that deliver one observable UI outcome end-to-end. Avoid "edit file X" or "add styles for Y" unless the change is truly isolated.
2. **User-Verifiable:** Every issue should have a "How to verify" section that describes what a user (or agent) will see or do to confirm the task is complete.
3. **Spec-Linked:** Every issue must link back to the specific part of the UI spec it implements or fixes.
4. **Actionable:** Issues must contain enough detail (props, tokens, microcopy) that an agent or developer can implement them without re-reading the entire spec package.

## Modes

This skill produces one of two outputs depending on context:

| Mode | When to use | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Markdown** | Default. Safe and portable. | Markdown issue drafts. |
| **Tracker** | Only when explicitly requested and tracker is configured (e.g. `gh` CLI). | Creates issues in the tracker + produces a summary report. |

Default to **Markdown** mode unless the user explicitly says to create the issues in a tracker.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Consume Inputs

Gather the source documents:
- **Primary:** `acceptance.md`, `redlines/redline-audit.md`, or `ui-spec-reconcile` report.
- **Context:** The full spec package (`brief.md`, `screen-spec.md`, etc.).

### Step 2 — Identify Slices

Analyze the requirements/findings and group them into vertical slices. A slice usually covers:
- A specific user journey step.
- A meaningful state transition.
- A coherent sub-surface or component (if it has its own verifiable behavior).

**Grouping Priority:**
1. **User behavior / Interaction** (e.g., "Implement Reel generation success state")
2. **State / Edge case** (e.g., "Add error handling for empty carousel")
3. **Component-level polish** (only if the component is complex enough to merit its own issue)

### Step 3 — Draft Issues

For each slice, produce an issue draft. Do not create the issues in a tracker yet unless explicitly requested.

**Each draft must include:**
- **Title:** Clear, outcome-oriented (e.g., "Add Reels support to /create carousel")
- **Scope:** Which files and components are likely involved.
- **Requirements:** Bulleted list of what must be built/fixed.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Derived directly from `acceptance.md`.
- **References:** Links to the relevant spec files and redline items.

### Step 4 — Review and Refine

Review the set of issues with the user. Check for:
- **Dependencies:** Are the issues in a logical order?
- **Sizing:** Is any issue too large? (If it takes more than 1–2 agent turns, slice it thinner).
- **Completeness:** Is every item in the `acceptance.md` or redline report covered?

### Step 5 — Export

Output the final set of issues as a Markdown block. Do not create tracker issues unless the user explicitly asks and the tracker is configured.

## Output template

Include metadata about the export mode in the frontmatter:
```yaml
tracker_mode: markdown | github-cli | linear | local-files
```

Produce the issues as a single Markdown document:

```markdown
# UI Implementation Plan: <scope>

## Issue 1: <Outcome-oriented Title>
- **Labels:** `ui`, `frontend`, `<severity>`
- **Spec:** `<path-to-spec>#section`
- **Description:** <What and why>
- **Task List:**
  - [ ] Requirement 1
  - [ ] Requirement 2
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] <Criterion from acceptance.md>
- **Verification:** <How to verify visually or via test>

---

## Issue 2: ...
```

## Redline-to-Issue Coverage Map

If input is a `ui-redline` audit, the output **must** include a coverage map showing how each redline item is addressed:

```markdown
## Redline Coverage

| Redline ID | Category | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [K-1] | Finance path | #2 (Correct route registry) | covered |
| [K-2] | Active state | #1 (Implement active indicator) | covered |
| [K-3] | ARIA labels | #3 (Add accessibility markers) | covered |
| [K-4] | Rounded corners | #4 (Apply radius token) | covered |
| [K-5] | Icon spacing | deferred | known polish, tracked separately |
| [K-6] | Duplicate links | deferred | product decision pending |
```

**Requirements:**
- Every redline finding (especially critical items K-1..K-N) must have a fate: covered by an issue, deferred with justification, or explicitly marked as not_applicable.
- No redline item should disappear silently without an entry in this map.

## Acceptance criteria for this skill's output

- [ ] Issues are vertical slices of behavior, not horizontal architectural layers.
- [ ] Every issue contains a specific verification step.
- [ ] If input is a redline audit, redline-to-issue coverage map is included and complete.
- [ ] All items from the input (acceptance checklist or redline) are mapped to an issue.
- [ ] No "vague" tasks (e.g., "clean up code", "make it look modern") are included.
- [ ] Issues include direct links to the relevant UI specifications.
