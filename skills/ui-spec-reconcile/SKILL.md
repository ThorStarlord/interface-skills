# UI Spec Reconcile

A skill for synchronizing an existing UI spec package with the actual state of the implementation. Use this after a round of development, bug fixing, or redline audits to ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the intended (and implemented) reality.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill:
- After implementing fixes based on a `ui-redline` audit.
- When the implementation has evolved beyond the original spec and those changes are accepted as "target" behavior.
- To clear "stale" findings in a spec package after they have been addressed in code.
- To promote implementation-driven discoveries (e.g., edge cases found during coding) into the official specification.

## Core principles

1. **Spec as Source of Truth:** The goal is not to blindly copy code into the spec, but to update the spec so it correctly describes the *intended* state, using implementation as evidence of what is possible and verified.
2. **Conservative Updates:** Do not silently update the spec. Always propose changes first, especially if they represent a design decision rather than just a bug fix.
3. **Evidence-based:** Prefer `ui-redline` reports or `ui-inspector` reports as primary evidence for reconciliation.
4. **Distinguish Intent:** Clearly separate bug fixes (reconciling spec to intended state) from design changes (updating the intended state based on implementation reality).

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Gather Evidence

Identify the spec package to be reconciled and gather evidence:
- **Primary:** `redlines/redline-audit.md` (if it exists).
- **Secondary:** `redlines/inspector-report.md` or direct source code inspection.
- **Context:** The existing spec files (brief, blueprint, screen-spec, component-specs, microcopy, acceptance).

### Step 2 — Analyze Mismatches

Compare the implementation evidence against the current spec. Identify:
- **Resolved Items:** Redline findings that are now fixed in code and should be removed or marked as "Pass" in the spec/acceptance.
- **Implementation Drift:** Accepted changes in the UI that are not yet in the spec (e.g., a label changed during implementation for better clarity).
- **Stale Claims:** Statements in the spec that no longer apply to the implementation.

### Step 3 — Propose Reconciliation Plan

List every proposed change to the spec package. For each change, note:
- **File:** Which spec file is affected.
- **Change:** What exactly is being updated.
- **Reason:** Why this is being reconciled (e.g., "Matches verified fix for Redline Item #4").
- **Confidence:** High (verified by redline) or Low (inferred from code).

**Wait for user approval of the plan.**

### Step 4 — Apply Updates (Patch Mode)

If approved, update the spec files.
- Remove resolved defects from "Observed" sections.
- Update "Target" claims to match confirmed behavior.
- Update the `acceptance.md` checklist to reflect the new verified state.
- Update the `status` in the frontmatter if appropriate.

### Step 5 — Verify

Run `ui-spec-linter` on the updated package to ensure internal consistency.

## Output template

Produce a reconciliation report in the following format:

```markdown
# UI Spec Reconciliation Report: <scope>

## 1. Input Evidence
- Redline Audit: `redlines/redline-audit.md`
- Implementation: `src/components/...`

## 2. Reconciliation Summary
| Spec File | Changes Made | Resolved Items |
|---|---|---|
| `screen-spec.md` | Updated microcopy for primary action | #3, #5 |
| `component-specs/X.md` | Corrected accessibility role | #1 |
| `acceptance.md` | Marked 4 items as PASS | - |

## 3. Design Decisions Promoted
- [ ] List any implementation details that are now "canonical" design.

## 4. Remaining Gaps
- [ ] Items that could not be reconciled (e.g., pending product decision).

## 5. Result
**Status:** Reconciled / Partially Reconciled
```

## Acceptance criteria for this skill's output

- [ ] Every change to the spec is linked to evidence (redline, inspector, or code).
- [ ] Bug fixes are distinguished from intended design changes.
- [ ] `acceptance.md` is updated to reflect resolved items.
- [ ] Proposals are made before any edits are applied to the spec files.
- [ ] The report clearly states what was reconciled and what remains a gap.
